Connect your Android device and adb host computer to a common Wi-Fi network accessible to both.

Connect the device to the host computer with a USB cable.

Run CMD in platform tools directory
cd C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools

Set the target device to listen for a TCP/IP connection on port 5555.
$ adb tcpip 5555

Disconnect the USB cable from the target device.

Find the IP address of the Android device.

Connect to the device, identifying it by IP address.
$ adb connect device_ip_address

Confirm that your host computer is connected to the target device:
$ adb devices

List of devices attached
device_ip_address:5555 device

You're now good to go!

If the adb connection is ever lost:

Make sure that your host is still connected to the same Wi-Fi network your Android device is.

Reconnect by executing the adb connect step again.

Or if that doesn't work, reset your adb host:
adb kill-server

Then start over from the beginning.
